Day 21: Create a Bare Git Repository
üéØ Task
Set up a bare Git repository for the Nautilus development team on the Storage Server.
Requirements

Install Git using yum.
Create a bare repository named /opt/games.git.


‚úÖ Steps
1. Install Git
Install the Git package on the server:  
sudo yum install git -y

2. Create Bare Repository
Initialize a bare Git repository at the specified path:  
sudo git init --bare /opt/games.git


üîç Verification
Verify the repository was created correctly:  
ls -ld /opt/games.git
ls /opt/games.git

Expected Output:The directory /opt/games.git should exist, and its contents should include:  
branches  config  description  HEAD  hooks  info  objects  refs


üìñ Explanation
Bare Repository

A bare repository contains only Git metadata and no working files (no checked-out files or working tree).
It is typically used as a central repository for team collaboration.
Developers clone this repository and push/pull changes to it.
By convention, bare repositories often end with .git (e.g., games.git).

Highlights

Git Installation: Ensures Git is available on the server for repository management.
Bare Repository Creation: The --bare flag creates a repository without a working directory, ideal for shared use.
Verification: Checking the directory structure confirms the repository is set up correctly with essential Git components.
